            <h2>Robot Building</h2>
            <p>At the beginning, we used the chassis provided in class to assemble the robot and test it with a line-following prototype.
            Later, we designed several chassis with adjustments to the light shield, Arduino board, breadboards, and battery arrangements to enhance both the robot's performance and appearance.

        Adjustments are made iteratively, testing performance on straight paths, curves, and varying lighting conditions. Speed is slow at first(30), and then change P(large for frequency sweep, small for drag race), and then large D for large P. Generally we want D high when P is high to compensate for oscillation and the other way around. Usually I is 0 but we tweak it up for drag race.

                We had a blast putting together our robot and understanding how the code and components worked hand in hand to make it a fully functioning system. Looking back at it, we think we spent most of our time soldering components into the perfboards and think we could've definitely done better there. Overall it was a great experience and we couldn't be happier with our bot placing first in the competition.

                <strong>Franklin's comment:</strong><br>
                First of all, I just want to say that, Avi and I spent so much time at this project/competition. We went to Envision Makerspace almost every single day the week of the competition and the week before! If anything, we should get the first place considering how much time we spent on this compared to how much the course expects us to spend!
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, some of the time we spent on the robot wasn't efficient enough. Like Avi said, on the day before the 1st seeding round, we spent the whole afternoon and night soldering the perfboards for the photoresistors and potentiometers circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
                In hindsight, what do I think was the most important in making us win? The most important factor I think was the tweaking of the SPID values. I’m not saying that the physical parts of the robots were not important, but it is that a lot of the teams also did very well on the physical aspect of the robot. In fact, some teams' robots' designs were apparently better than us! (For example, lighter.) However, on Thursday night and Friday morning, I experimented our robot a lot on different tracks, and I had a very holistic memory and understanding of what SPID values should be for different types of tracks. This is quite the key for our win in my opinion. For example, for the loop track, most teams did not anticipate it to be not a perfect ellipse but a slightly odd and having some sharp angles loop. I was surprised to see it when I walked in on Friday morning too — but I did have quite some intuition on how the SPID values should be comparing to each other with that kind of shape of track. Where is this important intuition from? It is from the amount of trials and errors I did by trying a lot of different tracks with our robot.
